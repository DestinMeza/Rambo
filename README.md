# Rambo

Rambo is a G.O.A.P. bot that lives in the MMO RTS strategy game Screeps.

G.O.A.P. was developed by Jeff Orkin in the early 2000's while working on the AI system for F.E.A.R.
His AI's intention was to allow goal planning for NPCs to create a more immersive game experience.

I am using my own take of this idea to create a unique AI that can plan out ways to defeat online opponents in screeps.
